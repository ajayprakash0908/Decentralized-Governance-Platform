Decentralized Governance Platform

## Project Description
The Decentralized Governance Platform is designed to allow users to vote on critical decisions regarding a project. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures transparency, security, and fairness in decision-making processes.

- **Enhanced Security**: Implement cryptographic verification for secure voting.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Develop an intuitive UI for seamless user participation.

## Key Features
